    "\n",
    "The .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .profile files are all configuration scripts for shell environments in Unix-like operating systems, but they serve different purposes and are executed in different scenarios. Here's a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. .bash_profile\n",
    "Purpose: The .bash_profile script is executed automatically when a user logs in using a Bash login shell. This is typically the shell you see when you log in to a system remotely via SSH or start a terminal session in a text mode console.\n",
    "Usage: It's used to set up environment variables, paths, and other startup programs that should be configured once per session.\n",
    "Execution: It runs only once at the start of a login session.\n",
    "2. .bashrc\n",
    "Purpose: The .bashrc script is executed for non-login interactive shells. This typically includes new terminal windows or tab sessions in a graphical desktop environment.\n",
    "Usage: It's mainly used to configure the shell environment, such as setting aliases, functions, and shell options that should be available in every interactive shell session.\n",
    "Execution: It runs every time a new shell session is opened.\n",
    "3. .profile\n",
    "Purpose: The .profile script is similar to .bash_profile but is more general and can be used by other shells like sh, dash, or ksh.\n",
    "Usage: It is often used in environments where multiple types of shells are in use or when the system defaults to a different shell than Bash. It typically sets up environment variables and can call .bash_profile or .bashrc if Bash-specific settings are needed.\n",
    "Execution: Like .bash_profile, it runs at the start of a login session but is more shell-agnostic.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    ".bash_profile: Executed for login shells, usually at the start of a session, mainly for environment settings.\n",
    ".bashrc: Executed for non-login interactive shells, mainly for configuring the interactive environment.\n",
    ".profile: A more general startup script executed for login shells, especially in environments where different shells might be used.\n",
    "Typical Setup:\n",
    "On many systems, .bash_profile is configured to source (include) .bashrc to ensure that the settings in .bashrc are applied even during login sessions:\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) **Run the Script with `bash` or `sh`**\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sh script_name.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let’s say you have a script called `hello_world.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod +x hello_world.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the script**:\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ./hello_world.sh\n",

    "In Bash, both `echo` and `printf` are used to display text or output data to the terminal. However, they have some key differences in functionality, behavior, and usage. Here’s a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  printf \"%s\\n\" \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Usage**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - `echo` is simpler and easier to use for basic output.\n",
    "  - It automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output unless suppressed with the `-n` option.\n",
    "  - It has less formatting control compared to `printf`.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - `printf` is more powerful and flexible, similar to the C language’s `printf` function.\n",
    "  - It does not add a newline character automatically; you need to include it explicitly using `\\n`.\n",
    "  - It provides more control over formatting, making it suitable for more complex output needs, such as formatting numbers, aligning text, etc.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"%s\\n\" \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Portability**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - `echo` may behave differently across different systems or shells (e.g., with how it handles special characters like `-e` or backslashes).\n",
    "  - Some implementations of `echo` treat options like `-e` (to enable interpretation of backslash escapes) and `-n` (to suppress newline) differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - `printf` is more consistent across different environments because it adheres more closely to POSIX standards.\n",
    "  - It's more reliable for scripts that need to be portable across different Unix-like systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Special Characters and Escape Sequences**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - Handles escape sequences depending on the options used (e.g., `-e` for enabling backslash escapes).\n",
    "  - Example with escape sequence:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    echo -e \"Line1\\nLine2\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - Provides precise control over escape sequences and formatting.\n",
    "  - Example with escape sequence:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"Line1\\nLine2\\n\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Formatting Capabilities**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - Limited formatting capabilities. Mostly used for simple text output.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - Offers advanced formatting, similar to C's `printf`. You can format strings, numbers, align text, and more.\n",
    "  - Example of formatting a number:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"Number: %04d\\n\" 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Output: `Number: 0005`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Use `echo`**: When you need simple, quick text output with minimal formatting needs.\n",
    "- **Use `printf`**: When you need precise control over formatting, need to print data without an automatic newline, or require more advanced output formatting. \n",

    "- **`$$`**: The process ID of the current shell.\n",
    "- **`$!`**: The process ID of the last background command.\n",
    "- **`$_`**: The last argument of the previous command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using `shift` to Handle Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shift` command is used to shift the positional parameters to the left. This effectively discards the first argument and moves all other arguments one position down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do\n",
    "    echo \"Processing argument: $1\"\n",
    "    shift\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running the Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./example.sh arg1 arg2 arg3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Processing argument: arg1\n",
    "Processing argument: arg2\n",
    "Processing argument: arg3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Quoting Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "When passing arguments that contain spaces or special characters, it's essential to quote them to ensure they're treated as single arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"First argument: $1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running the Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./example.sh \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "First argument: Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Default Values for Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign default values to arguments if they are not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "name=${1:-\"Default Name\"}\n",
    "echo \"Hello, $name!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running the Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./example.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Default Name!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positional Parameters**: Accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc., they allow you to retrieve arguments passed to the script.\n",
    "- **Special Parameters**: Provide information about the script's execution (`$?`, `$$`, `$!`, etc.).\n",
    "- **Functions**: Arguments can also be passed to functions, and handled similarly to how they are in the script.\n",
    "- **`shift`**: Useful for processing arguments in a loop by discarding the first argument each time.\n",
    "- **Quoting**: Important for handling arguments with spaces or special characters.\n",
    "- **Default Values**: Can be set using parameter expansion to ensure your script behaves predictably when arguments are missing."
