    "\n",
    "The .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .profile files are all configuration scripts for shell environments in Unix-like operating systems, but they serve different purposes and are executed in different scenarios. Here's a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. .bash_profile\n",
    "Purpose: The .bash_profile script is executed automatically when a user logs in using a Bash login shell. This is typically the shell you see when you log in to a system remotely via SSH or start a terminal session in a text mode console.\n",
    "Usage: It's used to set up environment variables, paths, and other startup programs that should be configured once per session.\n",
    "Execution: It runs only once at the start of a login session.\n",
    "2. .bashrc\n",
    "Purpose: The .bashrc script is executed for non-login interactive shells. This typically includes new terminal windows or tab sessions in a graphical desktop environment.\n",
    "Usage: It's mainly used to configure the shell environment, such as setting aliases, functions, and shell options that should be available in every interactive shell session.\n",
    "Execution: It runs every time a new shell session is opened.\n",
    "3. .profile\n",
    "Purpose: The .profile script is similar to .bash_profile but is more general and can be used by other shells like sh, dash, or ksh.\n",
    "Usage: It is often used in environments where multiple types of shells are in use or when the system defaults to a different shell than Bash. It typically sets up environment variables and can call .bash_profile or .bashrc if Bash-specific settings are needed.\n",
    "Execution: Like .bash_profile, it runs at the start of a login session but is more shell-agnostic.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    ".bash_profile: Executed for login shells, usually at the start of a session, mainly for environment settings.\n",
    ".bashrc: Executed for non-login interactive shells, mainly for configuring the interactive environment.\n",
    ".profile: A more general startup script executed for login shells, especially in environments where different shells might be used.\n",
    "Typical Setup:\n",
    "On many systems, .bash_profile is configured to source (include) .bashrc to ensure that the settings in .bashrc are applied even during login sessions:\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) **Run the Script with `bash` or `sh`**\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sh script_name.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let’s say you have a script called `hello_world.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod +x hello_world.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the script**:\n",

    "In Bash, both `echo` and `printf` are used to display text or output data to the terminal. However, they have some key differences in functionality, behavior, and usage. Here’s a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  printf \"%s\\n\" \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Usage**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - `echo` is simpler and easier to use for basic output.\n",
    "  - It automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output unless suppressed with the `-n` option.\n",
    "  - It has less formatting control compared to `printf`.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - `printf` is more powerful and flexible, similar to the C language’s `printf` function.\n",
    "  - It does not add a newline character automatically; you need to include it explicitly using `\\n`.\n",
    "  - It provides more control over formatting, making it suitable for more complex output needs, such as formatting numbers, aligning text, etc.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"%s\\n\" \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Portability**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - `echo` may behave differently across different systems or shells (e.g., with how it handles special characters like `-e` or backslashes).\n",
    "  - Some implementations of `echo` treat options like `-e` (to enable interpretation of backslash escapes) and `-n` (to suppress newline) differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - `printf` is more consistent across different environments because it adheres more closely to POSIX standards.\n",
    "  - It's more reliable for scripts that need to be portable across different Unix-like systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Special Characters and Escape Sequences**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - Handles escape sequences depending on the options used (e.g., `-e` for enabling backslash escapes).\n",
    "  - Example with escape sequence:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    echo -e \"Line1\\nLine2\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - Provides precise control over escape sequences and formatting.\n",
    "  - Example with escape sequence:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"Line1\\nLine2\\n\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Formatting Capabilities**\n",
    "- **`echo`**:\n",
    "  - Limited formatting capabilities. Mostly used for simple text output.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`printf`**:\n",
    "  - Offers advanced formatting, similar to C's `printf`. You can format strings, numbers, align text, and more.\n",
    "  - Example of formatting a number:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    printf \"Number: %04d\\n\" 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Output: `Number: 0005`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Use `echo`**: When you need simple, quick text output with minimal formatting needs.\n",
    "- **Use `printf`**: When you need precise control over formatting, need to print data without an automatic newline, or require more advanced output formatting. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. **Quoting Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "When passing arguments that contain spaces or special characters, it's essential to quote them to ensure they're treated as single arguments.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Default Values for Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign default values to arguments if they are not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Script:**\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "- **Functions**: Arguments can also be passed to functions, and handled similarly to how they are in the script.\n",
    "- **`shift`**: Useful for processing arguments in a loop by discarding the first argument each time.\n",
    "- **Quoting**: Important for handling arguments with spaces or special characters.\n",
    "- **Default Values**: Can be set using parameter expansion to ensure your script behaves predictably when arguments are missing."

    "### Understanding `xpg_echo`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Behavior of `echo`**: By default, the behavior of the `echo` command in Bash can vary slightly depending on the system and the version of Bash you are using. Typically, `echo` does not interpret escape sequences (like `\\n` for newline or `\\t` for tab) unless explicitly instructed to do so using the `-e` flag (e.g., `echo -e \"Hello\\nWorld\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`xpg_echo` Enabled**: When the `xpg_echo` option is enabled, the `echo` command treats escape sequences according to the XPG standard. This means that `echo` will automatically interpret escape sequences without needing the `-e` flag.\n",

    "### How to Use `xpg_echo`\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Enabling/Disabling `xpg_echo`**: You can enable or disable the `xpg_echo` option using the `shopt` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Enable `xpg_echo`**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    shopt -s xpg_echo\n",

    "Redirection in Bash allows you to control where input and output go, enabling you to send the output of commands to files, read input from files, or append data to files. Here’s a breakdown of the redirection operators `>`, `>>`, and `<`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Output Redirection: `>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**: Redirects the standard output (stdout) of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  echo \"Hello, World!\" > output.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation**: The string `\"Hello, World!\"` is written to `output.txt`. If `output.txt` already exists, its contents will be replaced with `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect**:\n",
    "  - If `output.txt` exists: The file's contents are overwritten.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **`printf '%s\\n%v\\n' OK? Oops!`**:\n",

    "   - **`'%s\\n%v\\n'`**: The format string used by `printf`.\n",
    "     - **`%s`**: A format specifier for a string.\n",

    "     - **`OK?`** corresponds to `%s` in the format string.\n",
    "     - **`Oops!`** would correspond to `%v`, but as `%v` is not valid, this will cause an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`> FILE`**:\n",
    "   - This redirects the standard output (stdout) of the `printf` command to a file named `FILE`. If `FILE` already exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`2>&1`**:\n",

    "2. The command will likely produce an error due to the invalid `%v` format specifier.\n",
    "3. Both the successful output (`OK?`) and the error message related to `%v` will be written to `FILE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Content of `FILE`:\n",

    "### 1. **Reading Input from the User with `read`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read` command is used to take input from the user or from a file. It reads a line of input and assigns it to one or more variables.\n",

    "  read name\n",
    "  echo \"Hello, $name!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - The script prompts the user with \"Enter your name:\".\n",
    "  - It waits for the user to input their name and press `Enter`.\n",
    "  - The input is stored in the variable `name`.\n",
    "  - The script then prints \"Hello, `name`!\", using the input provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading Multiple Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "read var1 var2 var3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",

    "  read a b c\n",
    "  echo \"You entered: $a, $b, $c\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "  - The user is prompted to enter three values separated by spaces.\n",
    "  - The first value is assigned to `a`, the second to `b`, and the third to `c`.\n",
    "  - The script then prints out the values entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Using `read` with Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read` command has several useful options that can change its behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`-p`**: Prompt the user with a message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read -p \"Enter your name: \" name\n",

    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read -sp \"Enter your password: \" password\n",
    "  echo\n",
    "  echo \"Password entered.\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - The input is not displayed as the user types (useful for sensitive information like passwords).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`-t`**: Timeout after a certain number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  if read -t 5 -p \"Enter your name within 5 seconds: \" name; then\n",
    "      echo \"Hello, $name!\"\n",
    "  else\n",
    "      echo \"Time's up!\"\n",
    "  fi\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - The script waits for 5 seconds for user input. If no input is provided within the timeout, it prints \"Time's up!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`-n`**: Limit the input to a certain number of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read -n 1 -p \"Press any key to continue...\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - The script waits for the user to press a single key before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`-r`**: Prevents backslashes from escaping characters (useful for reading file paths or raw input).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read -r filepath\n",
    "  echo \"You entered: $filepath\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - Backslashes are treated as literal characters rather than escape characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Reading Input from a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read input from a file line by line using a `while` loop combined with `read`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  while IFS= read -r line; do\n",
    "      echo \"Line: $line\"\n",
    "  done < input.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - **`IFS=`**: Sets the Internal Field Separator to an empty value to preserve leading/trailing whitespace.\n",
    "  - **`read -r line`**: Reads each line from the file without interpreting backslashes.\n",
    "  - **`< input.txt`**: Redirects the content of `input.txt` to the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **What Happens**:\n",
    "  - Each line of `input.txt` is read and stored in the variable `line`, then printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Reading Input from a Command**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use command substitution to read input from the output of a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read current_user <<< \"$(whoami)\"\n",
    "  echo \"Current user is $current_user\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The output of the `whoami` command is assigned to the variable `current_user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Handling User Input with Defaults**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide a default value for a variable if the user does not input anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  read -p \"Enter your name [Default: John]: \" name\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`read`**: The primary command for reading input in Bash, whether from the user or from files.\n",

    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Filter and process text data, like logs, with commands such as `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `cut`.\n",
    "2. **System Administration**: Combine commands like `ps`, `top`, `grep`, and `kill` to manage processes.\n",
    "3. **File Manipulation**: Use `find`, `xargs`, `grep`, and `awk` to locate and process files in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to Keep in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order Matters**: The order of commands in a pipeline is crucial since the output of one command becomes the input of the next.\n",
    "- **Resource Use**: Each command in a pipeline runs as a separate process, so complex pipelines can be resource-intensive.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Piping handles only stdout. If you need to handle stderr (error messages), you may need to redirect it explicitly using `2>&1` or similar constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Piping in Bash is a powerful feature that allows you to chain together commands, making the output of one command the input for another. This enables efficient and streamlined data processing, system administration, and file manipulation. By understanding and leveraging pipes, you can perform complex tasks with simple, modular commands, enhancing both your productivity and the clarity of your scripts."

    "\n",
    "### How `tee` Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reads input from stdin**: The `tee` command reads data passed to it through a pipe.\n",
    "2. **Writes to stdout**: It outputs this data to the terminal (stdout), so you can see it.\n",
    "3. **Writes to one or more files**: It also writes the same data to one or more specified files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`-a` or `--append`**: Appends the output to the file(s) instead of overwriting them.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Basic Use of `tee`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to list all files in the current directory and save the output to a file while still seeing the output on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -l | tee output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - `ls -l` lists the files in the directory with details.\n",
    "  - `| tee output.txt` writes the output to `output.txt` and also displays it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output** (on the screen and in `output.txt`):\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The `-a` option tells `tee` to append the output to `output.txt` rather than overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Writing to Multiple Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write the output to multiple files by specifying more than one file name:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - This command writes the output of `ls -l` to both `output1.txt` and `output2.txt`, as well as displaying it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Using `tee` with `sudo`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to write output to a file that requires elevated permissions, but you still want to see the output on the screen. `tee` is useful for this:\n",

    "Command substitution in Bash is a powerful feature that allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as input or as a value within your script. This can be used to assign the output of a command to a variable, pass it as an argument to another command, or even embed it directly within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common syntaxes for command substitution in Bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using backticks (`` `command` ``)**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   result=`command`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `$(command)` (recommended)**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   result=$(command)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `$(command)` Over Backticks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: The `$(command)` syntax is more readable, especially when commands are nested.\n",
    "- **Nestability**: You can easily nest commands using `$(command)`, while with backticks, it can become confusing and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Command Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Assigning Command Output to a Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store the output of a command in a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "current_date=$(date)\n",
    "echo \"Today's date is: $current_date\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - `$(date)` runs the `date` command and captures its output.\n",
    "  - The output is stored in the `current_date` variable.\n",
    "  - `echo` prints the value of `current_date`.\n",

    "#### 2. **Using Command Output in a String**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can embed the output of a command directly within a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"The current directory is $(pwd)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",

    "#### 3. **Using Command Output as Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass the output of a command as an argument to another command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "files=$(ls *.txt)\n",
    "tar -czf archive.tar.gz $files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - `$(ls *.txt)` captures the list of `.txt` files in the current directory.\n",
    "  - The list of files is passed as arguments to the `tar` command to create an archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Nesting Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest command substitutions to perform more complex tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "result=$(echo $(date +%Y) is the year)\n",
    "echo $result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The inner `$(date +%Y)` gets the current year.\n",
    "  - The outer `$(echo $(date +%Y) is the year)` forms a complete sentence, capturing it in `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "2024 is the year\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command substitution** allows you to capture the output of a command and use it within your script or command line.\n",
    "- **Syntax**: Use `$(command)` (recommended) or backticks (`` `command` ``) for command substitution.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**: Assigning command output to variables, embedding command output within strings, passing output as arguments, performing calculations, and more.\n",
    "- **Readability**: Prefer `$(command)` over backticks for better readability and easier nesting.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`generate_random_number()` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function generates a random integer part and a random decimal part.\n",
    "   - `integer_part=$(($RANDOM + 1000))` ensures that the integer part of the number is at least 1000.\n",
    "   - `decimal_part=$(($RANDOM % 100000))` generates a decimal part with up to 5 digits.\n",
    "   - The function then concatenates the integer and decimal parts to form a random number in the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop to Generate Numbers**:\n",
    "   - The `for i in {1..4}` loop generates four random numbers by calling the `generate_random_number` function.\n",
    "   - Each number is added to the `random_numbers` variable, with a newline character separating each entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing to File and Variable**:\n",
    "   - The `random_numbers` variable, which now contains all four generated numbers, is written to `output_file` using `echo`.\n",
    "   - The script also prints the generated numbers to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the script to a file named `generate_random_numbers.sh`, make it executable, and run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x generate_random_numbers.sh\n",
    "./generate_random_numbers.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the script might produce output similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Generated random numbers:\n",
    "11577.45679\n",
    "17427.9827\n",
    "14230.37421\n",
    "13918.1202\n",
    "\n",
    "The random numbers have been saved to random_numbers.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The numbers generated will be different each time you run the script due to the use of `$RANDOM`."
